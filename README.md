# firstwebsite

Hi!

I want to show you something. I've been immersed in the world of the web for the past few months, and now I finally have something to show off - my first website. https://vimat.org/

You know, when you start learning something from scratch, it seems so huge and overwhelming. HTML, CSS, a bunch of incomprehensible terms... There were moments when I wanted to just give up because nothing was working. Seriously, sometimes I would sit for hours on end over one little thing, googling, watching videos, re-reading the documentation a hundred times, and it still didn't work! And then suddenly - click! - you find a solution, and everything starts to come together. It's a feeling I can't describe!

This website is not just pages with text and pictures. For me, it's the result of all those sleepless nights, all those “aha!” moments when you realize how the next tag or property works. Each element here is a small victory. I really got high when I saw something coherent and functional grow out of the simple code I wrote myself. Even if it is still a simple website, it is already a level for me!

I realize that it is still far from perfect - I can already see where I could add animations, make it faster or more interactive. But that's probably normal when you can see where to go next. The main thing is that I made it myself, from start to finish!

I would love to hear your opinion. I would be grateful for any comments or advice. What would you have done differently? What is it that catches your eye? Feedback is very important to me now to understand where to grow further.
